# Function for selecting robust nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) programs
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

# - nmf_programs = a list; each element contains a matrix with NMF programs (top 50 genes) generated for a specific cell line using different NMF factorization ranks. 
# - intra_min = minimum overlap with a program from the same cell line (for selecting robust programs)
# - intra_max = maximum overlap with a program from the same cell line (for removing redundant programs)
# - inter_filter = logical; indicates whether programs should be filtered based on their similarity to programs of other cell lines
# - inter_min = minimum overlap with a program from another cell line 

# Returns a character vector with the NMF programs selected
